    <description>This library is designed for transforming objects through an object Mapper / Merger, which contains a set of actions for mapping properties from source object into destination object.
This library can be useful when applications need to transform business data into DTO objects, or maybe in another complex context when (for example) applications need to set some properties, and this is possible by custom filters.</description>
